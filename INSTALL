The objectives on PCSC-Lockin are:
- low cost data aquisition
- reproduce lock-in amplifier performance

Data aqusition on acoustic chopping frequency using a computer sound card. 
It simulates a lockin system with an algorithm described in
the documentation. The sound cards have as tipically 24bit ADC, providing
a good resolution. The two channels of the sound card are used to take the 
signal and the chopper.

A preamp with maximum 5Vpp on the output can be assembled by an operational 
amplifier, some resistors and some capacitors. Then this preamp has to be 
connected to the sound card.

PCSC-Lockin was developed on Ubuntu. This software is simple to compile. 
It need only two librarys, Qt for GUI and ALSA for sound card.




On Ubuntu 11.04

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libasound2-dev

Open a terminal into the source folder (where is this README file)

qmake [single.pro or multi.pro]

make

copy the executable into /usr/local/bin/
